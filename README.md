# Spatial Data Processing
The purpose of this repository is to perform spatial and temporal data processing steps using Apache Sedona on the raw dataset of NYC Taxi Trip records (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). The final goal is to convert the dataset into two tensors: i) spatial grid tensor where spatial NYC taxi zone is converted into a grid of m by n cells, and each cell in the grid contains a feature vector of taxi trip records, ii) spatio-temporal tensor where total spatial NYC taxi zone is divided into a number of polygons/zones, and number of taxi pickups happened at each of the spatial zones are recorded in a temporal requence of 1 hour interval.

## Downloading Dataset
In order to experiment with NYC taxi trip dataset, download the 'Yellow Taxi Trip Records' for January 2009 from the site: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page. Put the downloaded CSV file inside this folder 'data/taxi_trip'. The file name should be 'yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv'. Other datasets are available under 'data' folder.
